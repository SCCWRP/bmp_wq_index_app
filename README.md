# BMP WQ/Hydrology Index Calculator
An application which will allow users to upload their own BMP Monitoring data and get a Hydrology Performance Index or Water Quality Performance Index score in return.  

Originally was developed for the Water Quality performance index, which is why the repository name reflects such, but the user-facing portion of the application should not lead them to believe that this app is only for the Water Quality Index.
